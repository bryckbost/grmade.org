<p>If you're a designer or developer, I could use your help. For example, I know my jQuery could definitely be refactored, and I'm not much of a designer, so I've shared the Illustrator files for the logo. Have at it!</p>

<p>The site is built using Jekyll. You can check out the code and design files on GitHub.</p>

<p>I'm building this site in my free time, so any help, even if it comes in design or development suggestions, would be greatly appreciated!</p>
